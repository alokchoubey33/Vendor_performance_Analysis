# 📊 Vendor Performance Analysis
   ##Using Python,Sql
This repository contains a complete **Vendor Performance Analysis** project, designed to help businesses optimize vendor management, inventory decisions, and profitability. The analysis was conducted using **Python**, **Jupyter Notebook**, and **SQLite**, and targets key business stakeholders who need insights into underperforming brands, top vendors, inventory turnover, and purchasing strategies.

## 🚀 Project Overview

Retail and wholesale companies often face challenges such as:
- High inventory holding costs
- Vendor over-dependency
- Poor profit margins on certain products

This project analyzes vendor and product performance using sales, cost, and inventory data to answer key questions like:
- Which vendors are most and least profitable?
- Are bulk purchases reducing unit costs?
- Which products have high inventory but low turnover?
- Should certain brands be promoted or discounted?
